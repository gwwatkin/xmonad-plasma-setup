# My High Productivity Desktop Set-up
Runs [Xmonad](https://xmonad.org/) inside [Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/). Plasma provides useful features like the plasma-nm tool for managing wifi and and krunner for finding programs and files, while Xmonad manages windows effctively.

I keep this repo for myself to set up on new computers and to share in case someone finds it useful.

## Intallation
* Install plasma, xmonad and xmonad contrib
* move the xmonad.hs file to ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
* move the desktop file to the appropriate location (may vary, but hinted by the file path)
